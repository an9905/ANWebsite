            <h2>RUBRIC</h2>
            <p>In terms of the 6 content pages, I have done a home page, a culture page, a nature page, a tourist attraction page, a famous stadiums page, a foot spots page and lastly an about page. The Home page included a map of where 
                Queens NY is, along with a picture of me there. The culture page spoke about Queens' diversity along with the many events we host as a borough. Then the nature page spoke about the parks and beaches New York has. The Stadiums page 
                spoke about the famous New York teams and their stadiums. The food spots page obviously spoke about the delicious 
                food that Queens offers. The about page spoke about my inspiration for the webpages.
            </p><br>
            <p>In addition, I've also created a contact me / feedback page for visitor questions and comments. This page fulfills the rubric explanation. In the footer is a link to a references list, split and organized by page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lastly, I have completed the new version of Exercise 3 located within my website's exercises tab and my feedback page. It includes
                radio boxes, check boxes and functions within the javaScript file that checks form values. </p>
